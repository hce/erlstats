This is erlstats, a generic TS6 irc server framework written in Erlang
that can be used to implement IRC Services like ChanServ or Q or the
likes. The idea is to implement a small and very reliable and stable
core, around which many plugins can be implemented.

Each plugin is implemented as a generic server (gen_server) and can
but does not have to provide one or more users to the IRC network.

The base erlstats package comes with three sample plugins:

greasel  * Checks connecting users against a DNSBL blacklist
fricka   * Checks for compliance with hackint-specific rules
stats    * Generate stats every two minutes to be used with MUNIN

The code in the master branch runs live and in production on the
hackint IRC network (www.hackint.org).
