This is erlstats, a generic TS6 irc server framework that can be used
to implement IRC Services like ChanServ or Q or the likes. The idea is
to implement a small and very reliable and stable core, around which
many plugins can be implemented.

Each plugin is implemented as a generic server and can but does not
have to provide one or more users.

The base erlstats package comes with two sample plugins:

greasel  * Checks connecting users against a DNSBL blacklist
fricka   * Checks for compliance of miscellaneous rules

The code runs live and in production on hackint (www.hackint.org)
